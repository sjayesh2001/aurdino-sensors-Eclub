# MPU6050 

**Introduction**

In this tutorial we will learn how to use the MPU6050 Accelerometer and Gyroscope sensor with the Arduino.
The MPU6050 IMU has both 3-Axis accelerometer and 3-Axis gyroscope integrated on a single chip.
The gyroscope measures rotational velocity or rate of change of the angular position over time, along the X, Y and Z axis.
On the other hand, the MPU6050 accelerometer measures acceleration, along X, Y and Z axis.
The MPU6050 IMU is also called six-axis motion tracking device or 6 DoF (six Degrees of Freedom) device, because of its 6 outputs, or the 3 accelerometer outputs and the 3 gyroscope outputs.

**Components**

* 1 * Arduino Uno Board
* 1 * USB cable
* 1 * MPU 6050
* Jumper wires ( If MPU is attached on breadboard then Male to Male otherwise Female to Male)

**Experimental Procedures**

**Experiment 1**

In this tutorial we are going to learn how to read yaw,pitch and roll values from MPU.

**Step1:-**

Connect the circuit as shown in the following photo:

![connection](/MPU6050/images/Arduino-and-MPU6050-DMP-Interrupt-pin-circuit.png)

As you can see there are 5 connections Voltage, Ground, A5-SCL, A4-SDA, D2-INT and XCL, XDA, ADD are not used.

**Step2:-**

Now download the MPU6050 library from following [link](https://www.electronicshub.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/MPU6050.zip) and extract the content by unzipping the downloaded file. You will get a folder with name **MPU6050**. Copy this folder and paste it in the libraries folder of Arduino.

**Step3:-**

Now go to  **File -> Examples -> MPU6050 -> Examples -> MPU6050_DMP6** and open the example code **MPU6050_DMP6**.

**Step4:-**

Now compile the program by clicking on the **Verify** button or by pressing **Ctrl+R**.

**Step5:-**

Now upload the program on your arduino board by clicking on the **upload** button or by pressing **Ctrl+U**

**Step6:-**

Open the **tools-->Serial Monitor** and Set the baud rate in the serial terminal to 115200.
then you will see following photo.

**Experiment 2**

In this tutorial we are going to learn how to calibrate our mpu using the library we have previously installed.
Every sensor is different and unique, so we must find the unique Offset Values for the sensor we have.

**Step1:-**

Open Files and go to Examples in Arduino IDE.There, you will see a new library which says MPU6050 which contains a program named - 
IMU_Zero open it.

**Step 2:-**

Now compile the program by clicking on the **Verify** button or by pressing **Ctrl+R**.

**Step 3:-**

Now upload the program on your arduino board by clicking on the **upload** button or by pressing **Ctrl+U**

**Step 4:-**

Open the **tools-->Serial Monitor** There you will get to see the offset values of your MPU sensor.
