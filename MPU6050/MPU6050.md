## MPU6050 

**Introduction**

In this tutorial we will learn how to use the MPU6050 Accelerometer and Gyroscope sensor with the Arduino.
The MPU6050 IMU has both 3-Axis accelerometer and 3-Axis gyroscope integrated on a single chip.
The gyroscope measures rotational velocity or rate of change of the angular position over time, along the X, Y and Z axis.
On the other hand, the MPU6050 accelerometer measures acceleration, along X, Y and Z axis.
The MPU6050 IMU is also called six-axis motion tracking device or 6 DoF (six Degrees of Freedom) device, because of its 6 outputs, or the 3 accelerometer outputs and the 3 gyroscope outputs.
