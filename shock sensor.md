## SHOCK SENSOR

**Introduction** This shock sensor uses a SW-18015P switch to detect shocks, vibrations and impacts. There is no special library 
for this sensor as it is a simple sensor which consist of a switch which primarily consists of a terminal that forms a center 
post and a second terminal that is a spring that surrounds the center post. When a sufficient force is transferred to the switch,
the terminal consisting of the spring moves and shorts both terminals together momentarily. So, therefore output from this sensor
is either 0 or 1.
