# TEMP AND HUMIDITY MODULE(DHT11)

The **DHT11** is a commonly used **Temperature and humidity sensor.** The sensor comes with a dedicated NTC to measure temperature and an 8-bit microcontroller to output the values of temperature and humidity as serial data.
The sensor can measure temperature from 0°C to 50°C and humidity from 20% to 90% with an accuracy of ±1°C and ±1%.

There are two DHT11 sensors:-

*DHT11 sensor
*DHT11 sensor module

In DHT11 sensor there are four pins vcc,gnd,data(signal),NC while on the other hand DHT11 sensor module has three pins VCC,gnd,data(signal).

### PIN CONNECTION

In arduino VCC,gnd,data pins of module are connected to +5v,gnd,any analog pin respectively of arduino.

### CODE AND LIBRARIES

For arduino DHT11 has special libraries for using module in a simple and effective manner. For coding in arduino
install libraries, you can download it from following [link](https://www.arduinolibraries.info/libraries/dht-sensor-library).
Extract the zip file in the libraries folder in your arduino ide.
